In today's data-driven world, the role of data stewards has become increasingly crucial. Data stewardship ensures that data assets are properly managed, maintained, and utilized, aligning with organizational goals and regulatory requirements. This blog post delves into the overlapping roles and responsibilities of data stewards, drawing insights from various sources and practical examples.

## The Landscape of Data Stewardship

Data stewardship encompasses a broad range of activities and responsibilities, often tailored to the specific needs of an organization. According to the FAIRsFAIR project, data stewards can be embedded within research teams or serve as part of a central support service. This dual approach highlights the flexibility and adaptability required in data stewardship roles.

## Key Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. **Policy and Compliance**

Data stewards play a pivotal role in developing and enforcing data governance policies. They ensure that data management practices comply with legal and regulatory standards, which is essential for maintaining data integrity and trust.

### 2. **Data Management and Quality**

One of the primary responsibilities of data stewards is to oversee data quality. This involves managing metadata, ensuring data accuracy, and maintaining data consistency across the organization. Effective data management practices help in making informed decisions and driving innovation.

### 3. **Support and Training**

Data stewards often act as intermediaries between technical teams and business users. They provide training and support to researchers and other stakeholders, helping them understand and implement data management best practices. This role is crucial in fostering a data-centric culture within the organization.

## Overlapping Roles

Data stewardship roles often overlap with other positions within an organization. For instance, business analysts, data engineers, IT managers, and compliance officers may all take on data stewardship tasks as part of their broader job functions. This overlap ensures that data governance is integrated across all levels and domains, promoting a holistic approach to data management.

## Defining Key Roles

### **Data Steward**

A data steward is responsible for overseeing the management, quality, and governance of an organization's data assets. They ensure data is accurate, accessible, and secure, enabling organizations to make informed decisions while maintaining regulatory compliance.

### **Data Analyst**

A data analyst systematically collects, processes, and performs statistical analyses on data sets. Their responsibilities include gathering data, cleaning data, modeling data, interpreting data, and presenting findings to stakeholders.

### **Research Software Engineer**

A Research Software Engineer (RSE) combines professional software engineering expertise with an intimate understanding of research. They develop software for research projects, focusing on reproducibility, reusability, and accuracy of data analysis and applications.

### **Researcher**

A researcher conducts systematic and scientific investigations in a particular field of study. They design studies, collect data, analyze data, and interpret results to advance knowledge and solve real-world problems.

## Best Practices 
Focus on covering the basics first and build from there:

### **For Researchers**

1. **Document Data**: Ensure all data is well-documented to facilitate understanding and reuse.
2. **Use Standards**: Adhere to established standards for data collection and management.
3. **Deposit in a Repository**: Store data in a trusted repository to ensure long-term accessibility.
4. **Assign a License**: Clearly define the terms of use for your data.
5. **Get a PID**: Use Persistent Identifiers (PIDs) to uniquely identify and track your data.

### **For Services**

1. **Get Researchers Thinking Early**: Encourage the development of Data Management Plans (DMPs) at the start of projects.
2. **Advise on Standards**: Provide guidance on relevant data standards.
3. **Offer / Point to Repositories**: Direct researchers to appropriate repositories for data storage.
4. **Assign and Use PIDs**: Promote the use of PIDs for data tracking and management.
5. **Foster a Culture of Sharing**: Encourage data sharing and collaboration.
6. **Recognize and Reward FAIR**: Acknowledge and incentivize adherence to FAIR principles (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable).

## Conclusion

Data stewardship is a dynamic and multifaceted field, with roles and responsibilities that often overlap with other positions within an organization. By understanding and embracing these overlaps, organizations can ensure that their data assets are well-managed, compliant, and valuable. As the importance of data continues to grow, so too will the need for skilled and adaptable data stewards.
